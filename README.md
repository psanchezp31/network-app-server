#network-app-server
--

The application works by using the .jar found in the out / artifacts / networkApplicationServer_jar folder.
Deploying it opens a simple interface and starts listening for an open socket on the network. When successful connection shows a successful connection image.
To make the application fully work, it is convenient to use the application hosted in the repository https://github.com/psanchezp31/network-app-client, there you must read the readme.
